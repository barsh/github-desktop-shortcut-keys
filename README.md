# Github Desktop - Shortcut Keys

It would be nice if GitHub published a list of shortcut keys for their desktop apps but since they don't, here's what works as of 2017-04-24.

## Windows
- `a` - add repro
- `n` - new branch
- `b` - branches
- `t` - tools
- `ctrl`+`tab` - switch between changes and history
- `F5` - refresh
